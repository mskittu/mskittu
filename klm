As discussed, please find below the summary and next steps regarding the Extract and Transfer job flow for QA testing.

1️⃣ Current Flow (BAU):

We have four group jobs — Extract, Transfer, and Cloud Load (along with their grouped flow).

These jobs handle data extraction, transformation, and cloud loading.

2️⃣ QA Testing Approach:

The Extract and Transfer jobs will function the same in QA as in the current environment.

For unit testing/EAT, once the file is available on the P2P server,
→ We can copy the file from QA P2P server to the Dev P2P server.
→ Then run the Extract and Transfer jobs in QA, pointing to this copied file.

3️⃣ Additional Requirement:

We need to introduce one new TWS job after the Transfer job in the QA environment.

This job will make a copy of the same file for further processing.

Example command:

cp V_ECM_Strategy_Batch_Input V_ECM_Strategy_Batch_RFT_Processing


This ensures that both files are available for downstream processes without impacting the original file.

4️⃣ Next Steps:

 Create the new TWS job in QA (to copy the file post-transfer).

 Test the Extract and Transfer jobs in QA using the copied file.

 Once development is complete, push updated code to QA for end-to-end validation.

Please confirm if this approach looks good, or let me know if any further setup is required.
